# Discord-Bots
This is where I will post my open-source Discord bots

Each bot has its own seperate document / terms so please do read them <br/>
I hope you enjoy!

# Issues
### If you find any issues with any bot, please do the following
- Create an issue on the repo with the tag "bug"

### How the issue should be formatted
> Which bot contains the issue <br/>
> What the issue is <br/>
> If you know what's causing it, state that too <br/>
> Which command the issue is in

#### For example,
<code>BOT: CupOfJava</code> <br/>
<code>CMD: ping</code> <br/>
<code>ERR: link to a gist of the full traceback log goes here</code> <br/>
##### NOTICE - that was an example, not a real issue. Also, extra merits if you take steps to ensure that the error is reproducible and not a one-time thing.


# Feature requests
### If you want to request a feature, please do the following
- Create an issue on the repo with the tag "feature request"

### What the issue should contain 
> Name of the bot <br/>
> Name of the feature <br/>
> A detailed description of what it will do <br/>
> Arguments (if any) <br/>
> Why it should be added to the bot <br/>
