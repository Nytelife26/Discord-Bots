# Discord-Bots
This is where I will post my open-source Discord bots

Each bot has its own seperate document / terms so please do read them <br/>
I hope you enjoy!

# Issues
### If you find any issues with any bot, please do the following
- Create an issue on the repo

### How the issue should be formatted
> Which bot contains the issue <br/>
> What the issue is <br/>
> If you know what's causing it, state that too <br/>
> Which command the issue is in

#### For example,
<code> 
BOT: CupOfJava
CMD: ping
ERROR:
NameError: name 'something' is not defined
</code>

##### NOTICE - that was an example, not a real issue. Also, extra merits if you take steps to ensure that the error is reproducible and not a one-time thing.


# Feature requests
### If you want to request a feature, please do the following
- Create an issue on the repo

### How the issue should be formatted
> Name of the bot

> Name of the feature

> A detailed description of what it will do

> Arguments (if any)

> Why it should be added to the bot
