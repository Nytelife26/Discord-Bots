# Discord-Bots
This is where I will post my open-source Discord bots

Each bot has its own seperate document / terms so please do read them <br/>
I hope you enjoy!

# Issues
### If you find any issues with any bot, please do the following
- Create an issue on the repo

### How the issue should be formatted
> Which bot contains the issue <br/>
> What the issue is <br/>
> If you know what's causing it, state that too <br/>
> Which command the issue is in

#### For example,
<code> 
In CupOfJava, the ping command produces errors, it says something about a variable being referenced before assignment and it's in the ping command.
</code>
##### NOTICE - that was an example, that is not a real issue. You should also be more specific than "it says something about" by telling me what it actually says [extra merits for pasting the issue into a Gist and giving me the link as that makes my life easier]


# Feature requests
### If you want to request a feature, please do the following
- Create an issue on the repo

### How the issue should be formatted
> Name of the bot

> Name of the feature

> A detailed description of what it will do

> Arguments (if any)

> Why it should be added to the bot
